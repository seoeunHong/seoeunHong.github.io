## Hello Word!
---
Hello everyone who is reading this post right now! This is **Seoeun Hong**. You can just call me **Sun☀️**. The pronunciation is pretty similar :)

This is my first time making my own blog and writing a post on it. So, it’s really exciting for me. Hopefully, I can upload more informatic posts here in the future and share thoughts with you guys

## Why I started this blog?
---
In this fall semester, I became a senior. As many seniors do, I also applied my resume to a bunch of companies to get a job as a software engineer. However, by the irony of fate, the situation in the IT industry was not good (It is still not good). Many big IT companies, such as FAANG, fired so many people, and the news of “hiring freezing” had been heard every day (and this is still ongoing). I already felt insecure because I thought I wasn’t ready, but I felt that feeling more after I heard those kinds of news.

Even under those circumstances, some companies gave me opportunities to interview. However, at that time, I had so much psychological pressure. I hadn’t done any interviews before, compared to other interviewers, my career and skills looked terrible, the future of job searching looked bleak, and I was in the situation to go back to my home country if I couldn’t find a job within one semester.

I went through interviews under a lot of stress, but the interviews went badly even for me and I didn’t hear anything after all my interviews.

After that, I thought a lot. I asked myself many questions, from whether I am going well right now to whether I am the right person for this major.

Asking myself a lot of questions and talking to a lot of people, I realized that I was not serious about my all career path and future. I was just in a hurry to follow the new environment and school life, and my classes. I never thought about what coding skill I have right now or studied and practiced to develop my own coding skills. I was just satisfied with finishing my current schoolwork. 

After lots of discussions with my family and friends, I decided to postpone my graduation and improve my own coding skills. And rather than just trying to learn a large amount of knowledge at once, I want to learn the process or theory of the project or study that I am doing right now properly and record it. That is why this blog was created.

## The goal of this blog
---
My current goal for this blog is to keep recording all the studying or projects that I am doing right now. 

The personal study I am currently trying to do is learning the Machine Learning concept for participating in one of the Kaggle contests. 
Also in the Spring semester, I am planning to take Big data, Data management, and Open Source Courses at my university.
I am also going to do a machine learning project at the Break Through Program hosted by Cornell Tech and if I am selected as an MLH fellowship member, I will also do the project in that program. 

Hopefully, I can upload a concise and logical post about all of these activities.

Please leave a comment or contact me if there is something to be improved or to discuss.

Thank you so much!
